CyberTipParser is a Python script that parses a CyberTip that is in the pdf format.  If your filenames are two lines you will need to go into the file and correct that.  Place the CyberTip in the same folder as the script and edit the "document" variable to reflect the name of the pdf.  You can change the file_name, where file names and hashes are written to, to anything you like.
